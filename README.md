Explanation
This widget is designed to offer users two authentication options: signing in and signing up using email. It displays two buttons arranged in a column:

Sign In Button:
When tapped, it navigates to a sign-in screen. The screen uses email as the authentication provider. After a successful sign-in (detected via an authentication state change action), the screen is closed (popped).

Sign Up Button:
Similarly, this button takes the user to a registration screen that also uses email for authentication. Once the user has successfully signed up, the screen is closed.

Both screens are provided by the Firebase UI Auth package and use a similar setupâ€”using the email authentication provider and disabling the auth action switch for simplicity.
